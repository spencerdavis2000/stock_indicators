#note: when I compared the numbers from the tens and hudreds position it failed 
# because the 57 in the 5th element and the 39 in the 12th did not match.
# I got 58 and 40 and the spreadsheet gave me 57 and 39.  However, when you look
# closely at it, the spreadsheet was 57.97 mine was 58.04 and the other was 
# 39.99 and mine was 40.10.  So it was not off an actual point.  Either way it is
# just a % point of the RSI of a stock which is not a significant difference.
