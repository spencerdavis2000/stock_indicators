#This is the calculation for the relative strength index (RSI)

Welles Wilder developed this indicator and is commonly used by traders to 
gauge the: momentum of a stock or instrument, as well as oversold and overbought
levels.  

This can also be used with price levels to show divergence (price going up and
RSI going down or vice versa)

30 and below is considered to be oversold
70 and above is considered to be overbought

As with all indicators, there is a duality.  In heavy trends, the RSI usually 
stays embeded 50 to 90 for a long time.  This is where it is more of a momentum
indicator.
However, this type of power usually happens less of the time, while most of the
time when the  market hits below 30 it will usually retrace back up, or if it
hits 70 or above it will usually retrace back down.

So, this is a pretty decent "exit indicator"

Calculations
===================
RSI = 100 - (100/(1+RS))

RS = Average Gain / Average Loss

difference = previous price - last price
	if difference >= 0
	it is called a "Gain"
	elsif difference =< 0
	it is called a ""
